# [Original project description](https://github.com/nanoboard/nanoboard/releases)
>What is Nanoboard: it is steganographic imageboard without centralized server or p2p: users share nanoposts by posting png-containers (with nanoposts hidden inside) on real imageboards (users negotiate which imageboard threads to use for posting containers in special Nanoboard thread).
>
>Nanoboard's goals are: speech of freedom, immortality and ownership of the imageboard. Nanoboard is able to use transport different from png-containers. One such alternative transport is: [BitMessage transport](https://github.com/nanoboard/nanoboard-bittransport).
